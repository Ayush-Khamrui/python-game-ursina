## Project Intent
It is a simple game (Bouncing Ball) which I have made using Python and a game library Ursina. In this the character moves left and right using arrow keys and one 
need to avoid the balls from touching the character. As soon as any of the ball touch the character it displays the final score and the game is over.

## Steps to use this Game:
1. Download and install Python.
2. use command prompt and type comman `pip install ursina --user`
3. Next download the source code and run the project.
